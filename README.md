aaPaths2020 gives a method allows you to find paths through the set of 20 amino acids. These paths can be optimized for any combination of dimensions that quantitatively describe Amino Acids. For this program we have restricted the 4 dimensions- Polarity, Hydropathy, Volume and Iso-Electricity. 

WeigangCode-The program allows you to take the set of amino acid paths from the aaPaths2020 and pair them with a a single path through the set of codons. The path was developed for 

pairplots2-  PairPlots2 gives you a method for comparing the distribution of errors associated with a genetic code. 

2020Plots-This plot, created using GGPLOT2, shows the distributions of errors associated to genetic codes created with paths through 20 amino acids.

2121Plots- This plot, created using GGPLOT2, shows the distributions of errors associated to genetic codes created with paths through 20 amino acids.
